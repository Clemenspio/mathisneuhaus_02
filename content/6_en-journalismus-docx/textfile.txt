Journalism

Responsibilities: Reportages, Interviews, Essays, Portraits, Reviews, Stage Moderations and Panels

As a journalist, I contribute texts in German and English to publications that align with my curious attitude. My interests oscillate between pop culture, contemporary music, visual arts, fashion, and politics. My engagement with all these subjects is united by critically reflecting on them. 

I focus on reportages, interviews, essays, reviews, and portraits: for a publication by diaphanes, I met journalists, DJs and cultural theorists in New York to talk to them about the taste-making abilities of algorithmic recommendation mechanisms, which resulted in the reportage “The Taste Machine”. For Source Type, I wrote essays that explore the aesthetics of the opioid crisis and the visual consequences of the ongoing legalization of psychedelic drugs. I portrayed artists such as Alfredo Jaar, Arthur Jafa and Pamela Rosenkranz for art publications and met others, such as Suzanne Ciani, Nicolás Jaar or Trajal Harrell and Terre Thaemlitz, for in-depth interviews.

A selection of these texts is both uploaded and linked here, more are available on request.
